## CH413
Warwick Advanced Computational Chemistry material

This module has three parts. The lecture material for each part are contained in respective folders

# Enhanced Sampling and Machine Learning methods (G. Sosso)

Methodological challenges:  a) Enabling molecular simulations of “rare events” such as chemical reactions and phase transitions; b) Taking advantage of molecular datasets to predict the functional properties of new chemical species.

Application domain: a) Crystal nucleation and growth; b) Drug discovery

# Density functional theory and materials modelling (R. J. Maurer)

Methodological challenges: Achieving chemical accuracy for interactions between molecules, and between molecules and surfaces; enabling computationally efficient evaluation of structural, thermodynamic, and spectroscopic materials properties in the mesoscopic regime

Application domain: (a) Hybrid and composite materials prediction, (b) Heterogeneous photo- and electrocatalysis.


# Time-dependent quantum dynamics (S. Habershon)

Methodological challenges: Efficient propagation of time-dependent wavefunctions and density matrices, determination of accurate potential energy surfaces for quantum dynamics, and accounting for non-adiabatic effects.

Application domain: Photochemistry of organic and biological molecules, light-harvesting for energy applications.
